    "Skyjo is a card game which can be played by 2 or more players. The goal of the game is to end the game with the lowest score. The game ends when any player gets over 100 points at the end of any round.\n",
    "The game is setup as follows:\n",
    "A deck consists of: \n",
    "- 5 cards with a value of -2\n",
    "- 10 cards with a value of -1\n",
    "- 15 cards with a value of 0\n",
    "- Values 1-12, 10 cards of each\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the game, each player is dealt a total of 12 cards. These cards are not to be seen, and are generally laid in a 4x3 grid in front of the player.\n",
    "On the first round, each player flips over 2 cards of their choice to start. For the sake of this game, 2 cards are chosen at random. The player with the highest total starts first.\n",
    "Players then perform the following actions in the given order:\n",
    "- Choose a deck to draw from. Players can either draw from the deck (which is unknown), or the last discard card (if it exists, this card is known).\n",
    "- Choose to keep drawn card, or discard it. (Generally, if drawn from the discard, this card is always kept)\n",
    "- Chose a card on their grid to perform the following action with:\n",
    "   - If discarded, chose an unknown card of their hand to flip\n",
    "   - If not discard, chose any card to replace with their drawn card\n",
    "Once a player has performed this last action, their turn is done and play passes to the next player.\n",
    "A round ends once any player has revealed all of their cards. When this happens, all players asides from this player have one more turn before the round ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a round ends, players total the values of all of their cards, and add it to their game total score.\n",
    "If any one player has a lower score than the player who revealed all their cards first, the player who \"went out\" first has to double their round's score.\n",
    "This repeats till any player hits 100 points or more at the end of a round, and the player with the lowest score at this time wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one special rule which is optional to play with, but is included for this model.\n",
    "If, at any point, a player reveals 3 of the same card in one column, this column is then cleared and removed for the rest of the round. Cards can be of any value though, so while clearing a column of 12s is highly beneficial, clearing a column of -2s is highly detrimental.\n",
    "The cleared cards are then added to the top of the discard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this model is to play a game of Skyjo. The model is trained by playing against 5 different algorithms, each of which is given different instructions on what to do for a given turn.\n",
    "- RandomBot: Always choses actions at random. (Random draw, random keep, random placement)\n",
    "- MiddleBot: Performs actions which are always low (If discard is below 7, take it. If card drawn is below 7, keep it. If drawn card is lower than any visible, replace it, if not, place it in the next unknown index)\n",
    "- SpeedBot: Performs actions as quickly as possible (Same logic as MiddleBot asides from placement. Unless drawn card can create highly benefical point decreases, given card on board is > 4 and drawn card < given card - swap them, it will place in the next unknown spot.)\n",
    "- SmartBot: General logic to perform as human as possible (If discard is lower than any given card on the board or low, take it. If drawn card is lower than any card on the board or is medium, keep it. Check all cards on the board and find the largest beneficial point difference to swap with.)\n",
    "- TripleBot: Performs actions which will create columns of the same card. (If discard is medium or card is on the board, take it. If drawn card is on the board medium, keep it. If card can be placed at a given index and create a clearable column, place it there, otherwise use same logic as Speed for placement.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms will be chosen at random to play against the model, with the hope that a diversified set of algorithms will create a model capable to combatting many types of gameplay\n",
    "\n",
    "This main notebook is meant to be used for the execution of the game, as well as creating and training a SkyNet model."
